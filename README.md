# Queue Examples Documentation

## Overview
This directory (`queque-examples/`) includes hands-on examples of implementing message queues and Kafka workflows. Each example can be executed independently.

---

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kafka (Containerized or local)
- Kubernetes (Optional for orchestration)

### Directory Structure
Each example is self-contained with the following:
- **Dockerfile**: Builds the container image.
- **example-specific scripts/**: Scripts to demonstrate queques.
- **README.md**: Example-specific instructions.

---

## Steps to Run Queue Examples
1. Navigate to the desired example folder:
   ```bash
   cd queque-examples/example-<name>
   ```
2. Build and run the example using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Verify execution by accessing the service:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

Each example includes detailed instructions in its own `README.md`.

---

## Notes
- Each example can run independently.
- Use `docker-compose` or Kubernetes to manage service orchestration.
- Modify ports and configurations as needed for your environment.
